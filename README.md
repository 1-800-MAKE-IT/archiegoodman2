ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @archiegoodman2
I'm currently working as a Developer/Junior Data Scientist at a large bank, and these are my projects for personal development. These are my goals:

Short Term 
  1. Basic Feed Forward Neural Network binary and multiclass classifier on both clean datasets and noisy ones
  2. Basic Convnet for image recognition
  3. Convnet using pretrained (frozen) layers and unfreezing + retraining the last few layers
  4. Visualizing/interpreting outputs of Convnet layers during image recognition tasks
  6. Time series Processing with 1DCNN (optional)
  7. Time series Processing with LSTM (including dropout)
  8. Autoencoder to clear data noise, then perhaps variational autoencoder
  9. GAN for synthetic data
  10. Transformer work - make Large Transaction model??
