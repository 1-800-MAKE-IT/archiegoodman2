👋 Hi, I’m @archiegoodman2
👀 I’m interested in ... Climbing, fitness, martial arts and surfing
🌱 I’m currently learning ... Data Science and Statistical Learning
💞️ My current main project ... a variety of applications of Deep Learning. Here is my to-do list. I am aim to complete all these projects using both clean and noisy datasets. I will primarily use the Functional API in Keras, but will also experiment with PyTorch. For all of these I will explore all common optimisation techniques such as regularization (dropout, L1, L2 etc), different batch sizes, different architectures, normalizations etc

Short Term 
  1. Basic Feed Forward Neural Network multiclass classifier on both clean datasets and noisy ones
  2. Basic Convnet for image recognition
  3. Convnet using pretrained (frozen) layers and unfreezing + retraining the last few layers
  4. Visualizing/interpreting outputs of Convnet layers during image recognition tasks

Medium Term
  6. Time series Processing with 1DCNN (optional)
  7. Time series Processing with LSTM (including dropout)
  8. Autoencoder to clear data noise, then perhaps variational autoencoder
  9. GAN for synthetic data
  10. Transformer work - make Large Transaction model??
