- 👋 Hi, I’m @archiegoodman2
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Climbing, fitness, martial arts and surfing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... C++, and building upon skills in Python, with other lower level languages to follow soon (Rust)
- 💞️ My current main project ... a neural net from scratch! I'm open to new ideas for uses cases. I'm currently coding the net in Python, and will optimise it in Mojo once finished, in order to learn lower level memory management skills. For this I'll need to install Linux
- 📫 How to reach me ... https://www.linkedin.com/in/archie-goodman-a0bb4b1b7/
