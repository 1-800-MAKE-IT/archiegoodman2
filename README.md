- 👋 Hi, I’m @archiegoodman2
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Climbing, fitness, martial arts and surfing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Javascript, having learnt Python, with lower level languages to follow soon
- 💞️ My current main project ... An app to recognise and translate handwriting using machine learning (including coding a full neural net from scratch in js). I'm open to new ideas though as I'm aware this isn't very original!
